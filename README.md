# Inter_Integrated_Circuit_I2C_COM
This repository will encompass concepts/codes related to I2C, a communication protocol used for data transmission between a sensor and a microcontroller or between microcontrollers'..

The basic circuit connection looks like this, if using or enabling internal pull-up resistors these resistors are not required. But the preferred way is to use external pull ups to have more control over the communication..
