# Inter_Integrated_Circuit_I2C_COM
This repository will encompass concepts/codes related to I2C, a communication protocol used for data transmission between a sensor and a microcontroller or between microcontrollers'..

- The basic circuit connection looks like this.
- If using or enabling internal pull-up resistors these external resistors ( <img width="64" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5113f966-d756-4924-b845-cf493f48d1b7" /> ) are not required. 
- But the preferred way is to use external pull-ups to have more control over the communication.
